# Ingredients
- [ ] eggs -> 4
- [ ] onions -> 1 small
- [ ] olive oil -> 2 tbs
- [ ] black pepper -> to taste
- [ ] peeled tomatoes -> 320 g
- [ ] basil leaves -> a little, just for garnish

# Steps
1. Pour some oil into a pan and add chopped onions. Saute them for 8-10 minutes until they are soft and translucent.
2. Crush the peeled tomatoes with your hands and add them to the pan, then salt and mix.
3. Cover with a lid and let it cook on low heat for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. 
4. Remove the lid, make 4 wells for the eggs and break them. 
5. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper, cover again, and still at a gentle temperature cook them for another 5 minutes. Make sure that the eggs are not overcooked, the yolk should remain soft.
6. Garnish with hand-torn basil and the dish is done!
