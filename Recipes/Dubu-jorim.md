2. Add the cooking oil on a pan and heat it up on a high heat.
3. Set the tofu into a pan and cook for 7-8 minutes until it becomes golden brown. Then flip and do the same on this side.
4. Transfer the tofu to a plate but keep the oil in the pan.
5. Have your pan on medium-high heat. Add chopped onion, garlic, and green onions (less than 1 tbs, to be used for garnish later) to the pan. Stir with a wooden spoon until the onion becomes a little crispy.
6. Add a sauce made with soy sauce, salt, sugar, pepper flakes, water to the pan. Keep stirring it until the sauce reduces a bit and thickens. 
7. Add tofu and braise for a minute until the tofu absorbs some of the flavor of the sauce. Add some toasted sesame oil and stir.
