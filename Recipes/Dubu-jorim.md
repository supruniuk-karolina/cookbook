# Ingredients
- [ ] tofu -> 1 pack (500 g)
- [ ] cooking oil -> 3 tbs
- [ ] toasted sesame oil -> 1 tsp
- [ ] toasted sesame seeds -> 1 tsp
- [ ] garlic -> 1 clove, minced
- [ ] onion -> 120 ml, minced
- [ ] green onions -> 2, chopped
- [ ] soy sauce -> 1 tbs
- [ ] salt -> 1 tsp
- [ ] sugar -> 1 tsp
- [ ] korean hot pepper flakes (gochugaru)-> 1 tbs
- [ ] water -> 120 ml

# Steps
1. Rinse tofu in cold water and dry it with cotton paper towel. Cut into 1 cm thick bite size pieces.
2. Add the cooking oil on a pan and heat it up on a high heat.
3. Set the tofu into a pan and cook for 7-8 minutes until it becomes golden brown. Then flip and do the same on this side.
4. Transfer the tofu to a plate but keep the oil in the pan.
5. Have your pan on medium-high heat. Add chopped onion, garlic, and green onions (less than 1 tbs, the rest will be used for garnish later) to the pan. Stir with a wooden spoon until the onion becomes a little crispy.
6. Add a sauce made with soy sauce, salt, sugar, pepper flakes, water to the pan. Keep stirring it until the sauce reduces a bit and thickens. 
7. Add tofu and braise for a minute until the tofu absorbs some of the flavor of the sauce. Add some toasted sesame oil and stir.
8. Sprinkle some sesame seeds over the top and add the rest of the green onions. Serve right away with rice.
