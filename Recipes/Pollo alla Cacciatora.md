> This recipe is originally from [[Tuscany]]. Originally you should cook the whole chicken, but I will go with chicken thighs.
# Ingredients
- [ ] chicken thighs -> 800 g
- [ ] onion -> 1
- [ ] celery -> 1 rib
- [ ] red wine -> 100 g
- [ ] rosemary -> 1 spring
- [ ] peeled tomatoes -> 400 g
- [ ] carrots -> 1
- [ ] garlic -> 1 clove
- [ ] extra virgin olive oil
- [ ] parsley -> 1 spring
- [ ] black pepper
# Steps
1. Chop the onion, carrot and celery in cubes.
2. Clean the chicken
3. Heat a drop of oil in a pan, don't put too much, because chicken skin will release a lot of fat. Then put the chicken pieces with the skin side down.
4. Let it brown for about ==10 minutes==, turning it after a bit. 
5. When the chicken is well colored, add the chopped vegetables, a clove of peeled garlic. Then add salt, pepper and rosemary, stir and let it flavor together for another ==5 minutes==.
6. Blend with red wine and let the alcoholic part evaporate completely.
7. Remove the rosemary and garlic clove and add the chopped peeled tomato pieces.
8. Mix everything together and cover with a lid, let cook on a moderate heat for another ==30-35 minutes==. 
9. When finished cooking, make sure it is salted right and sprinkle with chopped parsley. You can also add some olives.

**Yupiii chicken is ready, go eat hero!!**
