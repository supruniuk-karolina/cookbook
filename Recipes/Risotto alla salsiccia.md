1. Remove the casing of the sausage, cutting in 2 centimeters pieces.
2. In a saucepan, heat 2 tbs of olive oil, add the sausage and let it brown for about ==7 mins== over medium-high heat.
3. Cut the shallot into thin slices and add it to the pan. Mix well.
4. Add the fresh thyme leaves and deglaze it with white wine, scraping the bottom of the pan well with a wooden spoon to deglaze it. Brown the sausage pieces for another ==5 minutes==.
5. Transfer the sausage into a bowl. Pour the rice into the same pan, without adding oil. Let it roast for another 3-4 minutes, stirring often. 
6. Gradually add the hot broth, making sure to wait until it is absorbed before adding more. Stir continuously until the rice is cooked. After about 15 mins, add the sausage.
7. Mix well and add one last time a little bit of broth. 
8. Taste and adjust the salt. Remove the pot from the stove and add the cold butter and graded parmigiano.
9. Stir gently and cover with a lid. Let it rest for a minute.
10. Stir everything to create a creamy consistency, serve and add some more garlic and thyme.
