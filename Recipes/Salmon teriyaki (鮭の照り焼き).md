> This is a dish that is frequently made at home or packed in bento boxes. Teriyaki isn't a sauce as Westerns and Europeans think, but rather a cooking method, which means glossy grilled using a sweet-savory sauce. "Teri" stands for glossy shine and "yaki" means to grill or pan-fry. 

# Ingredients
- [ ] raw salmon -> 2 pieces
- [ ] flour -> 1 tbs
- [ ] vegetable oil -> 1 tsp
- [ ] **A** soy sauce -> 1 tbs
- [ ] **A** sake -> 1 tbs
- [ ] **A** mirin -> 1 tbs
- [ ] **A** sugar -> 1 tsp
- [ ] salt -> to taste
- [ ] black pepper -> to taste

# Steps
1. Sprinkle salmon with a light amount of salt and let it sit for around 10 minutes to reduce the fishy smell.
2. After that, sprinkle a little pepper over it and coat it with flour (a rough guideline is around 1 tbs for every 2 pieces of salmon). It should be just thinly coated, so remove any excess flour if needed. 
3. Mix the **A** ingredients in a bowl to make a sauce.
4. Heat 1 tsp of oil in a pan, and, when the oil is hot, start frying salmon with the skin side down.
5. Cook for 2-3 minutes and then flip it, when browned. Add the sauce from the **A** ingredients. 
6. Continue moving the salmon while the sauce is reducing to coat the salmon well with the sauce. 
7. When the sauce is reduced, make a low heat and make sure that salmon is covered on all sides.

**All done cutie chef, go enjoy your quality foods!! Meshiagare (this means have a nice meal, but its said by a host or the one who cooked btw).**
